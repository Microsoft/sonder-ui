# Modal

A modal dialog is an overlay that obscures all other page content while it is open. Visually, this is often done with an opaque or semi-transparent backdrop. Programmatically, keyboard focus needs to be prevented from entering background content, and background content must be hidden from the accessibility tree and assistive tech.

## Semantics

On a basic level, a modal must have `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` set. In order to make the background page content unavailable, there are a couple options: the `inert` attribute or `aria-hidden`. One of those should be on the ancestor of all elements that are not part of the modal itself. The `aria-modal` attribute is supposed to accomplish this on its own, but support is still incomplete.

Here is example markup for a modal dialog (not including background page content):

```html
<div aria-labelledby="dialog-heading" role="dialog" tabIndex="-1">
  <h2 id="dialog-heading">Dialog Title</h2>
  <button type="button">
    <span class="visuallyHidden">close</span>
  </button>
  <div class="dialog-content">
    Dialog content goes here.
  </div>
</div>
```

The dialog is named with `aria-labelledby`, which is necessary here since it is the focus target when opened. Even if the dialog itself were not receiving focus, it should still be given a name.
