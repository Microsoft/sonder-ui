    <h1>Usability Study Links</h1>

    <h2>Grid</h2>
    <a href="/studies/grid/index.html">Grid study index</a>
    <p>Participants: would be useful to know how much data entry each participant has, as context for their feedback. Mobile is less important, and the list given on the call sounded great. The idea to ask for a rating and general comments after each grid would also be fantastic.</p>

    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <a href="/studies/forms/index.html">Form study index</a>

    <h3>Forms: Notifications (4)</h3>
    <p>Participants: More geared to screen reader users (both desktop and mobile) and zoom software. At least one or two people with cognitive disabilities would also be useful, and a braille device user would also be great.</p>

    <h3>Forms: Tooltips (4)</h3>
    <p>Participants: Less about screen reader users, though a few would still be good. This one is more focused on zoom software, anyone with a mobility disability (e.g. difficulty controlling a mouse with precision, even with no other assistive tech), and users with cognitive disabilities. Switch device usability could also be worth testing.</p>

    <h2>Modals (2)</h2>
    <a href="/studies/modal/index.html">Modal study index</a>
    <p>This is exclusively for users who use some sort of assistive tech in conjunction with a keyboard or switch. So screen readers, zoom + keyboard, and switch (though switch likely needs less emphasis than the other two). If you think of any other users who rely on a keyboard that I'm missing, feel free to add them.</p>

    <h2>One-off combobox (1)</h2>
    <a href="/studies/combobox-apg/index.html">Combobox page</a>
    <p>This should likely be exclusively focused on screen readers and braille displays (both desktop and mobile). The only differences are semantic, there should not be any meaningful differences in keyboard or mouse interaction.</p>

    <h2>APG Patterns</h2>
    <p>These are direct tests of patterns in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/">Aria Authoring Practices Guide</a>. They all one or two variations each. As broad a range of participants as possible would be ideal across the board.</p>
    <p>There is one special case: the variations in the treegrid example are likely only relevant to keyboard and screen reader users. I'd still like all participants to try it out, though non-screen reader or keyboard users could probably stick with just one version.</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>Tooltips</h2>
    <a href="/studies/tooltip/index.html">Tooltip study index</a>
    <p>This study focused more closely on tooltips, specifically their impact primarily on users with low vision,and those using screen readers or mobility-related assistive tech. It looks at different ways to dismiss tooltips, and includes tooltips both in a toolbar and on form fields within a modal.</p>

    <h2>Storefront (mixed study)</h2>
    <a href="/studies/storefront/index.html">Storefront study index</a>
    <p>This study looks as a couple different patterns: it revisits interactive grid keyboard patterns, and tests variations on splitbuttons.</p>
